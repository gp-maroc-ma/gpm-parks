Developed within the framework of Law 13-09 regarding renewable energies, the project represents a significant 
contribution to Morocco's green energy infrastructure.

- Project: GreenPower Morocco 1 (Operational)
- Location: Hjar Ennhal, Tangier-Asilah
- Capacity: 30 MWac
- Surface Area: 72 hectares
- Annual Production: Approximately 67 GWh
- Total Investment: 37 million USD

### Technology & Infrastructure

The GPM 1 solar park utilizes state-of-the-art equipment designed to guarantee clean, reliable, and high-performance 
energy production.

- **Solar Tracking:** The panels are mounted on horizontal-axis solar trackers aligned in a North-South direction. This 
technology allows the panels to follow the sunlight from sunrise to sunset, maximizing energy production throughout 
the day.
- **Energy Conversion:** Photovoltaic panels capture solar energy and convert it into electricity. This output is 
optimized by inverter systems that ensure a stable and efficient transformation of the current.
- **Grid Integration:** The energy produced is transmitted via transformer stations and delivery substations, allowing 
for safe and seamless integration into the national electrical grid.

This system offers fluid, secure operation compliant with industry best practices while supplying green electricity to the network.
